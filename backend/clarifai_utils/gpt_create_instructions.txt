{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "description": "Engage in gentle flexibility exercises, such as stretching or yoga, to maintain joint range of motion and reduce stiffness.",
      "duration": "1 hour"
    },
    {
      "description": "Light resistance training, using bands or light weights, to strengthen muscles and support bone health",
      "duration": "1 hour"
    }
  ],
  "overview": "Short explanation of the goals for the week"
}
